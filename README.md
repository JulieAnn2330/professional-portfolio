This is a homework assignment that I created for the University of Kansas Coding BootCamp. 

My professional portfolio is a big part of being employer-ready. I have chosen to highlight four projects that I am especially proud of, with links to the GitHub repositories and the deployed prujects. An enhanced feature that I added is a fully funcntional email message platform, utilizing Formspree.

I utilized several coding websites for help, including StackOverflow and w3schools.com I also watched YouTube tutorials and got assistance from fellow student Aurora Brune
